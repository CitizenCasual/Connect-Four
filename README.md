## Pseudocode:

- [ ] Define variables that track the game ex. whose turn it is, the array to represent the board, and if either player has won.

- [ ] Create cached elements for each bubble, the messages that are displayed on the page, the information box, and the play button

- [ ] When the game opens, it should assign values to the state variables, and listen for user input (player clicking a bubble)

- [ ] The winning combos should be defined in a constant

- [ ] Make an event listener to render the proper player style per click on bubble

- [ ] Make a replay button that resets the game to initial load state

- [ ] The info button, when clicked, should show how many games were played, and how many games each player won. These values will be updated with each game
